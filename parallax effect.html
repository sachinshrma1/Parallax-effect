                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky Adventures
                may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving,
                river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal
                or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by
                such activities.

                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the
                suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br><br>

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.

            </div>
            <p class="para">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also
                be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in
                wave pools.
                <br><br>

                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
